                <input type="checkbox" id="mn-id1" class="margin-toggle" />
                <span class="marginnote">In this collection, you'll learn what makes a Progressive Web App special, how they can affect your business, and how to build them. <a href="https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/">Learn more about Progressive Web Apps</a></span>
                HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript are the building blocks of the web.
                The ubiquity of these technologies makes them the perfect platform for building Progressive Web Apps.
                They are web applications that are fast, reliable, and engaging.
                They are also installable and work offline.
                All you require is a modern browser.
            </p>

                <label for="mn-id2" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
                <input type="checkbox" id="mn-id2" class="margin-toggle" />
                <span class="marginnote">Techniques, strategies and recipes for building a modern web app with multiple teams that can ship features independently. <a href="https://micro-frontends.org/">Learn more about micro-frontends</a></span>
                The term micro-frontends first came up in the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/micro-frontends">Thoughtworks Technology Radar</a> at the end of 2016.
                The idea is to break up a monolithic application into smaller, independent, and composable pieces.
                This allows for faster development, better code reuse, and easier scaling.
            </p>

                The longevity of the web is a testament to its flexibility and adaptability.
                The web is a platform that is constantly evolving and improving.
                It is a platform that is here to stay.
                Therefore we should embrace it and use it to its full potential.
                Progressive Web Apps are the future of the web.
                They are an easy way to develop mobile applications that work on all devices.

                    You can <a href="https://avanderw.co.za/joke">read more jokes</a> by visiting this project.</span>
                Ready for a laugh is a dad joke generator.
                It is also a simple example of how to build a Progressive Web App, but it is a good starting point.
                The goal of this project is to learn how to build a Progressive Web App.
                The app is built using HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript.
                The idea is to write future projects in a similar way.
                The expectation is that they will be easier to maintain and will survive the test of time. 
                Unlike Flash applications or Java applets, Progressive Web Apps will continue to work.

            <p>
                I am not very active on social media.
                I do have a presence on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/avanderw/">LinkedIn</a>, though you will not find me posting anything.
                I also upload to <a href="https://github.com/avanderw/">GitHub</a> as a form of backup mostly.
                I used to use GitHub to sync across devices, though have found <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a> to be a better solution.
                I love to game with friends and you can find me on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/avanderw/">Steam</a>.
                Here is my collection of <a href="https://cardboardbutler.azureedge.net/#usernames=avanderw">board games</a>.
