            <h2 id="spyfall">Ad-free Spyfall</h2>
            <p>I recently built a <a href="https://avanderw.co.za/spyfall">Spyfall Progressive Web App</a> (PWA) that
                has been a lifesaver for me and my friends. We are tired of using online versions riddled with ads and
                ruining our gaming experience. I made the original version using WebSockets to learn go and Websockets,
                but I plan on improving it even further. The future version will remove the dependency of needing to be
                online. However, one thing that surprised me was that PWAs require HTTPS; within that context, you have
                to make WSS connections. Luckily, since I self-host the app, I now own a cert for my home domain.
                Overall, I'm excited to continue developing this PWA and providing a seamless and ad-free gaming
                experience for all.</p>

            <h2 id="aoc">Advent of Code - Save Christmas</h2>
            <p>I sometimes participate in the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>, a coding
                challenge, every year in December. The challenge consists of a series of programming problems that
                increase in complexity as the days progress. As an avid coder, I was excited to participate and test my
                skills against others in the community.</p>

            <p>The Advent of Code is a fantastic experience! Each day brings a new challenge that pushes me to think
                creatively and outside the box. While some problems were more accessible than others, I learned
                something new with each one I solved. And the feeling of finally cracking a particularly tough problem
                was gratifying!</p>

            <p>As I progress through the challenge, I document <a href="https://avanderw.co.za/advent-of-code/">my
                    journey and solutions</a> in a write-up. I've included
                explanations of the problems, my thought process for solving them, and any obstacles I encountered. I
                hope that my write-up will be helpful to others who are considering participating in the Advent of Code
                or who want to learn more about programming.</p>

                <span class="marginnote"><img src="bitburner-logo.jpg" alt="Image of the Bitburner logo" /></span>
                As a programming enthusiast, I love working on console applications and exploring new ways to automate
                tasks. I'm excited to share my Bitburner scripts repository with you.
            </p>

            <p>My repository is a collection of evolving scripts that automate various tasks within <a
                    href="https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner/">Bitburner</a>, a popular text-based hacking
                simulator. I design these scripts to be modular and easy to customize, so you can use them to optimize
                your gameplay and increase your earnings.</p>

            <p>Some of the scripts in my repository automate hacking servers and stealing money, while others focus on
                upgrading your servers and optimizing your network. I'm constantly adding and refining new scripts, so
                there's always something new to try.</p>

            <p>Explore <a href="https://github.com/avanderw/bitburner-ts">my Bitburner scripts</a>, and feel free to
                download, modify, and share them with others. I'm always open to feedback and suggestions for
                improvements.</p>

            <p>While my Bitburner scripts repository may not be a formal project, it's a testament to my passion for
                programming and commitment to exploring new ideas. I hope these scripts are helpful and inspiring in
                your programming adventures.</p>

                While I don't prioritize social media, I have a professional <a
                    href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/avanderw/">LinkedIn</a> profile. I use <a
                    href="https://github.com/avanderw/">GitHub</a> to backup my work across devices, but I've since
                found that <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a> works better.
                When not working on tech projects, I spend my free time gaming with friends on <a
                    href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/avanderw/">Steam</a> or playing board games from <a
