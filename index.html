                HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript are the building blocks of the web.
                The ubiquity of these technologies makes them the perfect platform for building Progressive Web Apps.
                They are web applications that are fast, reliable, and engaging.
                They are also installable and work offline.
                All you require is a modern browser.

                The term micro-frontends first came up in the <a
                    href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/micro-frontends">Thoughtworks Technology
                    Radar</a> at the end of 2016.
                The idea is to break up a monolithic application into smaller, independent, and composable pieces.
                This allows for faster development, better code reuse, and easier scaling.

                The longevity of the web is a testament to its flexibility and adaptability.
                The web is a platform that is constantly evolving and improving.
                It is a platform that is here to stay.
                Therefore we should embrace it and use it to its full potential.
                Progressive Web Apps are the future of the web.
                They are an easy way to develop mobile applications that work on all devices.

                Ready for a laugh is a dad joke generator.
                It is also a simple example of how to build a Progressive Web App, but it is a good starting point.
                The goal of this project is to learn how to build a Progressive Web App.
                The app is built using HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript.
                The idea is to write future projects in a similar way.
                The expectation is that they will be easier to maintain and will survive the test of time.
                Unlike Flash applications or Java applets, Progressive Web Apps will continue to work when the tech
                changes.

            <h3>Spyfall</h3>
            <p>
                <label for="mn-id4" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
                <input type="checkbox" id="mn-id4" class="margin-toggle" />

                Spyfall is a social deduction card game where players try to figure out who among them is the spy.
                Spyfall can be a good game for a party, as it is designed to be played with a large group of people and
                has a social, interactive element that encourages players to engage with each other. The game's
                fast-paced, unpredictable nature and the pressure to bluff and think on your feet can make for an
                exciting and entertaining experience.

                There are many online versions of Spyfall. However, I wanted to build my own version. I started and
                dropped the project a few times, due to the quality of the online versions being so good. However, most
                of them have grown in complexity and incorporate ads nowdays. I wanted to build a simple version that is
                easy to use and does not require an account. After finishing the joke generator, I decided to pick up
                the project again. Seeing the opportunity for quick delivery.

                <span class="marginnote">The goal of this domain is to be accessible and very close to vanilla HTML. So
                    the site is statically hosted on GitHub and uses their cert for HTTPS. I tried to find free hosting
                    for a service after Heroku changed its usage policy. AWS's free offering could work, though it
                    locked me into their ecosystem. EC2 only has 720 hours free per month. So I self-hosted, which
                    required the cert.</span>
                As with most projects, there are lessons to be had. The complete build took about half a day. GitHub
                copilot helped speed things up. Though my lessons came with the distribution. The first lesson is that you
                require a secure web socket connection (wss://) when running on HTTPS. The second lesson being you need
                HTTPS to access <code>navigator.share</code> or <code>navigator.clipboard</code>, and you also require
                HTTPS to make the site a PWA, which led me to obtain a cert for the domain I use to host the go-lang
                service. Lastly, the service runs using 3MB RAMâ€”a massive improvement over Java.

                Every year since 2018 I have dabbled in the Advent of Code.
                The puzzles are designed to be solved in any programming language.
                I have not always completed the puzzles due to the challenge being over the holidays.
                However, I have always enjoyed the puzzles and the challenge.
                It is a great opportunity to learn new languages.
                In 2022 I decided to write about my experience and learnings.

                I am not very active on social media.
                I do have a presence on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/avanderw/">LinkedIn</a>, though you will
                not find me posting anything.
                I also upload to <a href="https://github.com/avanderw/">GitHub</a> as a form of backup mostly.
                I used to use GitHub to sync across devices, though have found <a
                    href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a> to be a better solution.
                I love to game with friends and you can find me on <a
