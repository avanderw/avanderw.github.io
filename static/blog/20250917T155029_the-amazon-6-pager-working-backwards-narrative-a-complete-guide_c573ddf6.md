# The Amazon 6-Pager

The 6-pager working backwards narrative is Amazon's signature approach to strategic planning and product development. This document-centric methodology transforms how organizations conceptualize, plan, and execute initiatives by starting with the customer outcome and working backwards to define the solution. Rather than beginning with internal capabilities or technologies, teams first articulate the customer problem, envision the ideal solution, and then determine what needs to be built to achieve that vision.

This guide provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and implementing the 6-pager approach, including its core principles, structural components, and practical applications. By adopting this methodology, organizations can improve decision-making quality, enhance customer focus, reduce miscommunication, and increase the likelihood of building products and services that truly matter to their customers.

## What is the 6-Pager Working Backwards Narrative?

The 6-pager working backwards narrative is a structured document format pioneered by Amazon for strategic planning, product development, and major business decisions. Unlike traditional PowerPoint presentations or brief proposals, the 6-pager is a detailed, prose-based document that thoroughly explores a business opportunity, challenge, or initiative.

The "working backwards" philosophy is central to this approach. Instead of starting with existing capabilities, technologies, or internal constraints, teams begin by clearly defining the customer problem and articulating what success looks like from the customer's perspective. This customer-centric starting point ensures that solutions are genuinely valuable rather than internally convenient.

The document format itself is deliberately constrained to six pages of narrative text, excluding appendices. This constraint forces authors to be precise, comprehensive, and strategic in their thinking. The narrative style, as opposed to bullet points or slides, encourages deeper analysis and clearer communication of complex ideas, dependencies, and trade-offs.

Key characteristics of the 6-pager include its focus on customer outcomes rather than features, its emphasis on detailed written communication over presentations, and its requirement for thorough pre-work before meetings. The document serves as both a thinking tool for the author and a communication vehicle for stakeholders, ensuring everyone has access to the same detailed information and reasoning.

## Why Do We Use This Approach?

The 6-pager working backwards methodology addresses several critical challenges that plague traditional planning and development processes. Most importantly, it ensures customer-centricity by forcing teams to start with customer needs rather than internal capabilities or existing solutions. This outside-in perspective dramatically increases the likelihood of building something customers actually want and will pay for.

Traditional planning often suffers from unclear communication, especially when complex ideas are condensed into bullet points or brief presentations. The narrative format of the 6-pager eliminates ambiguity by requiring authors to fully develop their thoughts and explain the reasoning behind their recommendations. When someone reads a well-written 6-pager, they understand not just what is being proposed, but why it matters and how it will work.

The format also improves decision-making quality by ensuring all stakeholders have access to comprehensive information before discussions begin. Rather than spending meeting time gathering context or clarifying basic concepts, participants can focus on substantive questions, concerns, and improvements. This leads to more informed decisions and better outcomes.

From an organizational learning perspective, 6-pagers create valuable institutional knowledge. Unlike presentations that capture only high-level concepts, these documents preserve the detailed thinking, assumptions, and trade-offs that went into major decisions. Future teams can reference these documents to understand why certain choices were made and apply similar reasoning to new challenges.

The working backwards approach also naturally incorporates risk assessment and contingency planning. By starting with the desired customer outcome and working backwards, teams are forced to identify potential obstacles, dependencies, and failure modes early in the planning process. This proactive risk identification leads to more robust solutions and better preparation for implementation challenges.

## How Do We Apply the Working Backwards Methodology?

Implementing the working backwards approach requires a fundamental shift in how teams approach planning and problem-solving. The process begins with customer research and problem definition, not solution brainstorming. Teams must invest time in understanding customer pain points, unmet needs, and desired outcomes before considering what to build or how to build it.

The first step is crafting a compelling customer narrative that describes the problem from the customer's perspective. This narrative should be specific, vivid, and grounded in real customer feedback or research. Avoid generic statements like "customers want better performance." Instead, describe specific scenarios where current solutions fail and explain exactly how this failure impacts the customer's goals or experience.

Once the customer problem is clearly articulated, teams work backwards to define what the ideal solution would look like. This solution description should focus on customer outcomes and benefits rather than internal features or technical specifications. What would customers be able to do that they cannot do today? How would their experience or results improve? What would they say about this solution to their colleagues or friends?

The working backwards process then identifies the key capabilities, resources, and components required to deliver the envisioned customer experience. This is where internal considerations like technology, operations, partnerships, and business model come into play. However, these elements are evaluated and designed in service of the customer outcome, not as starting points for the solution.

Throughout this process, teams should continuously validate assumptions with customers, stakeholders, and subject matter experts. The working backwards approach is iterativeï¿½new insights about customer needs or implementation challenges should inform refinements to both the problem definition and proposed solution.

Documentation is crucial during application. Teams should capture their reasoning, assumptions, and trade-offs in real-time rather than trying to reconstruct their thinking later. This documentation becomes the foundation for the final 6-pager document and ensures important context is not lost during the development process.

## What Do We Get Out of This Methodology?

Organizations that effectively implement the 6-pager working backwards approach consistently report significant improvements in both process efficiency and outcome quality. The most immediate benefit is enhanced clarity and alignment across teams and stakeholders. When everyone reads the same comprehensive document before meetings, discussions become more productive and focused on substantive issues rather than basic comprehension.

Customer satisfaction and product-market fit improve dramatically because solutions are designed from the customer's perspective rather than internal convenience. Teams that start with customer outcomes are more likely to build products and services that solve real problems in ways that matter to users. This customer focus also helps prioritize features and capabilities based on customer value rather than technical ease or internal preferences.

Decision-making quality increases because stakeholders have access to comprehensive information and detailed reasoning. Rather than making choices based on brief presentations or incomplete data, leaders can evaluate thorough analysis of opportunities, risks, trade-offs, and implementation approaches. This leads to more informed decisions and better long-term outcomes.

The methodology also creates valuable organizational learning and knowledge retention. Unlike presentations that capture only surface-level concepts, 6-pagers preserve detailed thinking, assumptions, and reasoning for future reference. New team members can quickly understand why certain decisions were made and apply similar logic to new challenges.

Risk management improves because the working backwards process naturally surfaces potential obstacles, dependencies, and failure modes. Teams identify and address risks early in the planning process rather than discovering them during implementation. This proactive approach reduces project failures and enables more robust contingency planning.

Finally, the approach cultivates better strategic thinking across the organization. Writing detailed narratives forces individuals to develop their ideas more thoroughly and consider broader implications of their proposals. Over time, this practice improves analytical skills and strategic reasoning capabilities throughout the team.

## When Should We Use the 6-Pager Approach?

The 6-pager working backwards methodology is most valuable for significant decisions, strategic initiatives, and complex problems that require thorough analysis and stakeholder alignment. However, it should not be used for every decision or communication, as the format requires substantial time investment and may be overkill for straightforward issues.

Strategic product launches, major feature developments, and new market entries are ideal candidates for the 6-pager treatment. These initiatives typically involve significant resource investments, multiple stakeholders, and complex customer considerations that benefit from comprehensive analysis. The working backwards approach ensures these high-stakes decisions are grounded in customer value and thoroughly considered from multiple angles.

Process improvements, organizational changes, and policy decisions also benefit from the 6-pager format, especially when they impact multiple teams or require cultural shifts. The detailed narrative helps stakeholders understand not just what is changing, but why the change is necessary and how it will improve outcomes for customers or the organization.

Budget planning, resource allocation, and investment decisions represent another strong use case. The comprehensive analysis required for a 6-pager helps leaders evaluate competing opportunities and make informed trade-offs about where to invest time, money, and attention.

However, the 6-pager approach is not appropriate for routine operational decisions, simple tactical choices, or urgent situations requiring immediate action. The methodology requires significant upfront investment in research, analysis, and writing that may not be justified for lower-stakes decisions or time-sensitive issues.

The format is also less suitable for highly technical topics that require specialized expertise to evaluate. While the narrative format can help communicate complex technical concepts, some decisions may be better served by alternative formats that allow for detailed technical specifications, diagrams, or data analysis.

Teams should consider their organizational context and stakeholder preferences when deciding whether to use the 6-pager format. Organizations new to this approach may want to start with smaller, less critical decisions to build familiarity and capability before applying it to major strategic initiatives.

## General Structure and Implementation Framework

The 6-pager working backwards narrative follows a consistent structural framework that ensures comprehensive coverage of essential elements while maintaining readability and logical flow. While specific sections may vary based on the topic and organizational context, most effective 6-pagers include the following core components.

The document opens with an Executive Summary that concisely presents the customer problem, proposed solution, key benefits, and required resources. This section serves as a standalone summary for busy executives while providing a roadmap for the detailed analysis that follows. The executive summary should be compelling enough to generate interest while being specific enough to enable informed initial reactions.

Customer Problem and Opportunity follows the executive summary and provides detailed analysis of the customer pain point or unmet need being addressed. This section should include specific customer examples, quantitative data where available, and clear articulation of why this problem matters to customers and the business. The goal is to create shared understanding and urgency around the customer need.

The Solution Description articulates what success looks like from the customer's perspective without diving into internal implementation details. This section describes the customer experience, key benefits, and outcomes rather than features or technical specifications. It should paint a vivid picture of how customers will interact with and benefit from the proposed solution.

Success Metrics and Goals define how the team will measure progress and evaluate outcomes. This section should include both customer-focused metrics (satisfaction, usage, outcomes) and business metrics (revenue, cost, efficiency) with specific targets and timelines. Clear metrics enable accountability and provide objective criteria for evaluating success.

Implementation Approach covers the key capabilities, resources, and timeline required to deliver the customer solution. This section bridges from customer outcomes to internal execution by identifying critical dependencies, potential obstacles, and required investments. It should provide enough detail to enable informed resource allocation and planning decisions.

The document concludes with Risk Assessment and Mitigation strategies that acknowledge potential challenges and describe how the team plans to address them. This section demonstrates thorough thinking and preparation while building confidence in the proposed approach.

Throughout the document, authors should use clear, jargon-free language that enables understanding across different functions and levels of the organization. The narrative should flow logically from customer problem to solution to implementation, with each section building on the previous content. Appendices can provide detailed supporting data, research findings, or technical specifications without cluttering the main narrative.

## Conclusion

The 6-pager working backwards narrative represents a powerful methodology for improving strategic thinking, customer focus, and decision-making quality across organizations. By starting with customer outcomes and working backwards to define solutions, teams consistently build more valuable products and services while reducing the risk of irrelevant or internally-focused initiatives.

Success with this approach requires commitment to the process, investment in developing writing and analytical skills, and organizational support for thorough preparation before major decisions. However, organizations that effectively implement the 6-pager methodology report significant improvements in clarity, alignment, customer satisfaction, and strategic outcomes.

The key to success lies in genuine commitment to customer-centricity and thorough analysis rather than simply adopting the document format. Teams must resist the temptation to start with solutions and instead invest the time and effort required to deeply understand customer needs and work backwards to optimal approaches.

As your organization begins implementing this methodology, start with smaller decisions to build familiarity and capability before applying it to major strategic initiatives. Focus on developing strong customer research and narrative writing skills while creating organizational norms that support thorough preparation and thoughtful decision-making.

The investment in adopting the 6-pager working backwards approach will pay dividends in improved customer outcomes, better strategic decisions, and more effective organizational learning. Most importantly, it will help ensure that your team's efforts are focused on building things that truly matter to the customers you serve.
