# My Personal Website

This repository contains the code for my personal website located at <https://avanderw.github.io>.

## About

I built this site to showcase my work and share a bit more about myself personally and professionally. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create an interactive, responsive site.

The site features different sections including:

About - A brief background and overview
Skills - Technical abilities and competencies
Projects - Notable works with images and descriptions
Contact - Ways to get in touch with me
And more. I will continue adding content over time.

## Usage

The site is hosted on GitHub pages and the main page can be accessed via the domain above. Feel free to poke around the code, just please provide attribution if reusing significant portions elsewhere.

## Customization

The site can be forked or cloned to make changes or use parts for your own purposes:

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
