Hey, Iâ€™m Andrew, sometimes known as `avanderw`.

I host this site with [github pages](https://github.com/avanderw/avanderw.github.io); built it using pandoc and bash to keep things simple.

Many moons back, I wanted to grow up to be a computer game programmer. I got a book from the school library on BASIC, copied my first "game" from the pages, only to realize it was nothing like I had expected. I grew up fast and was always fortunate to have had a computer to break. Today I work one of those boring corporate jobs. Though, to my surprise, it has been anything but boring.

> I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions. - Stephen R. Covey

My future holds lots of opportunities for me and others. I have learned a lot over the years, but knowing that I will always be learning is the most important lesson.

I am straight, blunt, and often to the point. Above all else, I value honesty. WYSIWYG, and I get shit done!
