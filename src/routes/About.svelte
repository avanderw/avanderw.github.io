	I offer consultancy services, specialize in custom development, and create innovative apps. My
	base of operations is in the vibrant city of Cape Town, South Africa, and I am open to travelling
	for projects.
</p>
<p>
	I launched my career in the consulting world, utilizing my expertise in Java and front-end
	technologies to deliver innovative solutions to clients. During this time, one of my clients
	introduced me to academia. I transitioned into a role as a developer at a university, where I
	collaborated with educators and researchers to enhance the institution's tech infrastructure.
	Subsequently, I made another transition, this time to a bank, where I eventually became the head
	of a fundamental division. This diverse experience honed my technical skills and sharpened my
	leadership abilities.
</p>
<p>
	In my spare time, I dedicated myself to tutoring mathematics for matric pupils, nurturing their
	academic growth. This commitment to education complements my formal educational journey, which
	includes earning a computer science degree and an MBA. These qualifications have provided me with
	a robust foundation for technical expertise and strategic thinking.
</p>
<p>
	I'm passionate about technology and education and look forward to new challenges and opportunities
	in both fields.
