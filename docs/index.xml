      <description>Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m Andrew, often known as avanderw on the internet.
Many moons back, I wanted to grow up to be a computer game programmer. I got a book from the school library on BASIC, copied my first &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo; from the pages, only to realize it was nothing like I had expected. I grew up fast. I was fortunate always to have had a computer to break. At varsity, I said I would never enter the boring corporate world.</description>
